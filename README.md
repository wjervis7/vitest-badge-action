# Vitest Badge Action

[![Validate Build][buildImg]][buildLnk] ![Lines][testLinesImg] ![Lines][testStatementsImg] ![Lines][testFunctionsImg] ![Lines][testBranchesImg]

This action will parse the json summary created by Vitest, and create a status badge based on the results, and optionally upload to a Gist.

## Usage

This action requres you to use Vitest to create a coverage report, with the `json-summary` reporter.

You can configure the reporter in `vitest.config.ts` file, like this

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
    test {
      coverage {
        reporter [json-summary]
      }
    }
});
```

You must execute `vitest --coverage`, in a step, prior to this action.

## Permissions

You must provide a PAT, with `write` permission, to your Gist, if you want to upload the badge.
